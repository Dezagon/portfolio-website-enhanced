          Hello and welcome to my resume website, my name is Antonio Hernandez
          and I love lifting weights and playing video games such as Minecraft,
          Marvel Rivals, and Pokemon. My interest in programming first sprouted
          when I created my own version of a Pokedex in Code.org's app lab back
          in high school in 2021, and I have been in and out of developing my
          own projects since then. Now, however, I am locked in and ready to
          learn, create, and develop.

            I see now that the circumstances of one's birth are irrelevant; it
            is what you do with the gift of life that determines who you are.
